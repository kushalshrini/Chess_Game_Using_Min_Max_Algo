# Chess_Game_Using_Min_Max_Algo

The Chess game is developed by using Min max Algorithm and Alpha-beta pruning . 
The approach is more efficient as compared to brute force method of building the chess 
game . This game is executed on a web brower (https://jsfiddle.net/q76uzxwe/1/) using JavaScript programming 
language and JSON .

**Alphaâ€“beta pruning** is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are 
evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It is an adversarial search algorithm used 
commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Go, etc.). It stops 
evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse 
than a previously examined move. Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a 
standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches
that cannot possibly influence the final decision.
